# ESP32-powered-AI-litter-collection-robot
One of the biggest problems in the world today is pollution which includes litter outside and in buildings. To help solve this problem, I am going to create a small autonomous robot capable of detecting and moving litter. This robot will be capable of removing plastic environment, in order to protect them.
I have attached an entire breakdown of the project's progress if the pdf file with the name "ESP32-powered-AI-litter-collection-robot"
